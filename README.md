# product_information_screen

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The provided code is a Flutter implementation of a product description page. It showcases the details of a Honda Activa 110cc vehicle, including images, ratings, vehicle information, and various settings. 

The page begins with a carousel slider displaying multiple images of the vehicle. Below the carousel, there is a row displaying the vehicle name, star rating, and the number of riders. The next section shows the vehicle registration number and a verified icon.

A button labeled "Vehicle Preview" is present, allowing users to preview the vehicle. It is followed by a switch component called LiteRollingSwitch, which represents the option to accept or decline ride requests. The remaining sections include a divider and a column with various settings.

The settings section presents different cards with icons, text, and an arrow icon for navigation. These cards represent different settings that can be accessed, such as pricing, pickup location, vehicle photos, vehicle description, availability, and notes for pickup.

This Flutter code provides a basic structure for a product description page and can be customized and enhanced according to your specific requirements.
